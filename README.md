GenDynToolkit
=============

This is a comprehensive toolkit for controlling the dynamic stochastic synthesizer. Besides direct parameter control and parameter automation, there are several original approaches developed here. First, the toolkit enables controlling the synthesizer with an audio signal. Relevant audio features of an input signal are mapped to the synthesis parameters making the control immediate and intuitive. Second, the toolkit supports MIDI control so that musicians can use standard MIDI interfaces to play the synthesizer. Based on this approach a polyphonic MIDI-controlled synthesizer was implemented and included it in the toolkit along with other examples of controlling the dynamic stochastic synthesizer. The toolkit was developed in the widely used visual programming environment Pure Data.
